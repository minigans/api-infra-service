## Testing the service

A few basic tests are available under sub-directories of this directory. The `test-all.sh` convenience script may be 
used to run them all:

```bash
./test-all.sh
```

The [test-all.out](https://gist.github.com/minigans/9053609fff860dfcb3fcf2f80d60e01e) snippet shows sample output for 
the currently deployed ingresses and docs.
